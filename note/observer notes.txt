originally intended to write chapter to address two complaint with observer:

1. it's unpredictable because you don't know when a notification happens. can
   be slow.

here, just wanted to show normal implementation is synchronous and
deterministic. doesn't have to pump message loop, use threads, etc.

2. it requires dynamic allocation when adding.

i *thought* i had a solution for this that cleverly threaded the list of
observers through the observers themselves. but that has the unpleasant
side effect that a given observer can only observe one object.

need to do more research and possibly just ditch this chapter.
