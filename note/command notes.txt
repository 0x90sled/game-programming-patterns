instead of separate "message" chapter, talk about this as command.

basic idea is representing a verb (method call) as a noun (object). making this
first class can help you have an "operation" span multiple objects. for example,
in combat you can have the attacker create a "hit" object that represents the
attack. this is basically a command.

that gets passed to the defender which then completes the attack.

this way, neither the attacking or defending class has to totally own the attack
logic.
