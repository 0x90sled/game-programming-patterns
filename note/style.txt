## Prose

- ## Headers are Title Caps
- ### And smaller are Sentence caps
- Use "Na√Øve" instead of "Naive"
- Use smart quotes
- No spaces around &mdash;
- Prefer present tense instead of future
- Prefer "we" over "you" or "I"
- Use *O(n&sup2;)* for Big-O notation, not `O(n^2)`
- Put class name in `CodeFont` when referring to the class itself.
  Ex: "Add a method to `Foo`."
- Use normal font and lowercase when referring to objects of the class.
  Ex: "Create a new foo and pass it to `bar()`."
- Q: Use parentheses when referring to methods/functions? `foo` or `foo()`?
- Q: `true` or true?
- Q: Are "enum", "struct", "int", etc. normal words or `code font`?

## Terminology
