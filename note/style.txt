## Prose

- ## Headers are Title Caps
- ### And smaller are sentence caps
- Use "Na√Øve" instead of "Naive".
- Use smart quotes.
- No spaces around &mdash;.
- Prefer present tense instead of future.
- Prefer "we" over "you" or "I".
- Use *O(n&sup2;)* for Big-O notation, not `O(n^2)`.
- Put class name in `CodeFont` when referring to the class itself.
- It's "Foo pattern", not "Foo Pattern", and the link just surrounds, "Foo".
  Ex: "Add a method to `Foo`."
- Use normal font and lowercase when referring to objects of the class.
  Ex: "Create a new foo and pass it to `bar()`."
- Design Patterns and other book titles are *italicized*.
- Q: Use parentheses when referring to methods/functions? `foo` or `foo()`?
- Q: `true` or true?
- Q: Are "enum", "struct", "int", etc. normal words or `code font`?
- Q: Hide fields behind getters (better style) or allow public fields (less
     boilerplate)?

## Terminology

- "vtable", all lowercase, no hyphen
- "on-screen" when an adjective ("the on-screen player"), "on screen" when a
  place ("the player is on screen")

## Code

- Indent cases?
- No "I" for interfaces.
- Trailing underscore for fields. That way isFoo() doesn't collide with isFoo
  field.
