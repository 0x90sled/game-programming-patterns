^title Design Patterns Revisited

*Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* is nearly twenty years old as I write this. By the time you read this, there's a good chance it will be old enough to drink. For an industry as quickly moving as software, that's nearly ancient.
That says something about how software architecture spans languages, technology, frameworks, and time.

While I think *Design Patterns* is still fully relevant, we've learned a lot in the past couple of decades. In this section, we'll walk through a handful of the original patterns the Gang of Four documented. For each pattern, I hope to have something relevant or interesting to say.

Some patterns I think are overused (<a href="singleton.html">Singleton</a>), while others are underappreciated (<a href="command.html">Command</a>). A couple are in here because I want to explore their relevance specifically to games (<a href="flyweight.html">Flyweight</a> and <a href="observer.html">Observer</a>). Finally, sometimes I just think it's fun to see how the pattern is embedded in the larger field of programming (<a href="prototype.html">Prototype</a> and <a href="state.html">State</a>).

## The Patterns

  * [Command](command.html)
  * [Flyweight](flyweight.html)
  * [Observer](observer.html)
  * [Prototype](prototype.html)
  * [Singleton](singleton.html)
  * [State](state.html)
