<h2><a href="#motivation" name="motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Imagine we&#x2019;re working on a fantasy role-playing game. Our task is to
write the code for the hordes of vicious monsters that seek to slay
our brave hero. Monsters have a bunch of different attributes: health,
attacks, graphics, sounds, etc., but for example purposes we&#x2019;ll just
worry about the first two.</p>
<p>Each monster in the game has a value for its current health. It starts
out full, and each time the monster is wounded, it diminishes.
Monsters also have an attack string. When the monster attacks our
hero, that text will be shown to the user somehow. (We don&#x2019;t care how
here.)</p>
<p>The designers tell us that monsters come in a variety of different
<em>breeds</em>, like &ldquo;dragon&rdquo; or &ldquo;troll.&rdquo; Each breed
describes a <em>kind</em> of monster that exists in the game, and there can
be multiple monsters of the same breed running around in the dungeon
at the same time.</p>
<p>The breed determines a monster&#x2019;s starting health: dragons start
off with more than trolls, making them harder to kill. It also
determines the attack string: all monsters of the same breed attack
the same way.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-typical-oop-answer" name="the-typical-oop-answer">The typical OOP answer</a></h3>
<p>Given that game design, we fire up our text editor and start coding.
According to the design, a dragon <span name="isa">is a</span> kind of monster, a troll is
another kind, and so on with the other breeds. Thinking
object-oriented, that leads us to a Monster base class:</p>
<aside name="isa">

<p>This is the so-called "is-a" relationship. In conventional OOP
thinking, since a dragon "is-a" monster, we model that by making
Dragon a subclass of Monster. As we&#x2019;ll see, subclassing is only one
way of enshrining a conceptual relation like that into code.</p>

<p>The public <code>getAttack()</code> function lets the combat code get the
string that should be displayed when the monster attacks the hero.
Each derived breed class will override this to provide a different
message.</p>
<p>The constructor is protected and takes the starting health for the
monster. We&#x2019;ll have derived classes for each breed that provide their
own public constructors that call this one, passing in the starting
health that is appropriate for that breed.</p>

<aside name="exclaim">

<p>Exclamation points make everything more exciting!</p>
</aside>

<p>Each class derived from Monster passes in the starting health, and
overrides <code>getAttack()</code> to return the attack string for that breed.
Everything works as expected, and before long we&#x2019;ve got our hero
running around slaying a variety of beasties. We keep slinging code,
and before we know it, we&#x2019;ve got dozens of monster subclasses, from
acidic slimes to zombie goats.</p>
<p>Then, strangely, things start to bog down. Our designers ultimately
want to have <em>hundreds</em> of breeds, and we find ourselves spending all
of our time writing these little seven line subclasses and
recompiling. It gets worse: the designers want to start tuning the
breeds we&#x2019;ve already coded. Our formerly productive work day
degenerates to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get email from designer asking to change health of troll from
    48 to 52.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check out and change <code>Troll.h</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recompile game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check in change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reply to email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We spend the day frustrated because we&#x2019;ve turned into data monkeys.
Our designers are frustrated because it takes them forever just to get
a simple number tuned. What we need is the ability to change breed
stats without having to recompile the whole game every time. Even
better, we&#x2019;d like designers to be able to create and tune breeds
without <em>any</em> programmer intervention at all.</p>
<h3><a href="#a-class-for-a-class" name="a-class-for-a-class">A class for a class</a></h3>
<p>At a very high level, the problem we&#x2019;re trying to solve is pretty
simple. We have a bunch of different monsters in the game, and we want
to share certain attributes between them. A horde of monsters are
beating on the hero, and we want some of them to use the same text for
their attack. We define that by saying that all of those monsters are
the same &ldquo;breed,&rdquo; and that the breed determines the attack
string.</p>
<p>We decided to implement this concept using inheritance, since it lines
up with our intuition of classes: A dragon is a monster, and each
dragon in the game is an instance of this dragon &ldquo;class.&rdquo;
Defining each breed as a subclass of an abstract base Monster class,
and having each monster in the game be an instance of that derived
breed class mirrors that. We end up with a class hierarchy like this:</p>
<p><span name="inherits-arrow"></span></p>
<p><img src="images/type-object-subclasses.png" /></p>
<aside name="inherits-arrow">

<p>Here, the <img src="images/arrow-inherits.png" class="arrow" /> means "inherits from".</p>
</aside>

<p>Each instance of a monster in the game will be of one of the derived
monster types. The more breeds we have, the bigger the class hierarchy. That&#x2019;s the problem of course: adding new breeds means
adding new code, and each breed has to be compiled in as its own type.</p>
<p>This works, but it isn&#x2019;t the only option. We could also architect our
code so that each monster <em>has</em> a breed. Instead of subclassing
Monster for each breed, we have a single Monster class and a single
Breed class:</p>
<p><span name="references-arrow"></span></p>
<p><img src="images/type-object-breed.png" /></p>
<aside name="references-arrow">

<p>Here, the <img src="images/arrow-references.png" class="arrow" /> means "is referenced by".</p>
</aside>

<p>That&#x2019;s it. Two classes. Notice that there&#x2019;s no inheritance at all.
With this system, each monster in the game is simply an instance of
class Monster. The Breed class contains the information that&#x2019;s
specific to a breed: starting health and the attack string.</p>
<p>To associate monsters with breeds, we give each Monster instance a
reference to a Breed object containing the information for that breed.
To get the attack string, a monster just calls a method on its breed.
The Breed class essentially defines a monster&#x2019;s &ldquo;type.&rdquo;
Each Breed instance is an <em>object</em> that represents a different
conceptual <em>type</em>, hence the name of the pattern: Type Object.</p>
<p>What&#x2019;s especially powerful about this pattern is that now we can
define new <em>types</em> of things without complicating the codebase at all:
we&#x2019;ve essentially lifted a portion of the type system out of the
hard-coded class hierarchy into data we can define at runtime. We can
create hundreds of different breeds just by instantiating more
instances of Breed with different values. If we create Breeds by
initializing them from data read from some configuration file, we have
the ability to define new types of monsters completely in data. So
easy a designer could do it!</p>
<h2><a href="#the-pattern" name="the-pattern">The Pattern</a></h2>
<p>Define a <strong>type object</strong> class and a <strong>typed object</strong> class. Each
<em>instance</em> of the type object class represents a different logical
type. Instances of the typed object class store a reference to the
type object that describes their type.</p>
<p>Instance-specific data is stored in the typed object instance, and
data or behavior that should be shared across all instances of the
same conceptual type is stored in the type object. Objects referencing
the same type object will function as if they were the same type. This
lets us share data and behavior across a set of similar objects, much
like subclassing lets us do, but without having a fixed set of
hard-coded subclasses.</p>
<h2><a href="#when-to-use-it" name="when-to-use-it">When to Use It</a></h2>
<p>This pattern is useful anytime you need to define a variety of
different &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of things, but baking the kinds into
your language&#x2019;s type system is too rigid. In particular, it&#x2019;s useful
when either of these are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You don&#x2019;t know what types you will need up front. (For example,
    what if our game needed to support downloading content that
    contained new breeds of monster?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to be able to modify or add new types without having to
    recompile or change code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#keep-in-mind" name="keep-in-mind">Keep in Mind</a></h2>
<h3><a href="#the-type-objects-have-to-be-tracked-manually" name="the-type-objects-have-to-be-tracked-manually">The type objects have to be tracked manually</a></h3>
<p>One advantage of using something like <span name="vtable">C++&#x2019;s</span> type system is that the
compiler handles all of the bookkeeping for the classes automatically.
The data that defines each class (primarily the vtables that control
which overridden functions gets called) is automatically compiled into
the static memory segment of the executable and just works.</p>
<p>With the Type Object pattern, we are now responsible for managing
not only our monsters in memory, but also their <em>types</em>: we have to
make sure all of the breed objects are instantiated and kept in
memory as long as our monsters need them. Whenever we create a new
monster, it&#x2019;s up to us to ensure that it&#x2019;s correctly initialized with
a reference to a valid breed.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ve freed ourselves from some of the limitations of the compiler,
but the cost is we have to re-implement some of what it used to be
doing for us.</p>
<aside name="vtable">

<p>Under the hood, C++ virtual methods are implemented using something
called a &ldquo;virtual function table&rdquo;, or just &ldquo;vtable.&rdquo; A vtable is a simple struct containing a set of
function pointers, one for each virtual method in a class. There is one vtable in memory for each class. Each instance of a class has a
pointer to the vtable for its class.</p>
<p>When you call a virtual function, the code first looks up the vtable
for the object, then it calls the function stored in the appropriate
function pointer in the table.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? The vtable is our breed object, and the pointer to the
vtable is the reference the monster holds to its breed. C++ classes
are the Type Object pattern applied to C, handled automatically by the
compiler.</p>
</aside>

<h3><a href="#it&#x2019;s-harder-to-define-behavior-for-each-type" name="it&#x2019;s-harder-to-define-behavior-for-each-type">It&#x2019;s harder to define behavior for each type</a></h3>
<p>With subclassing, you can override a method and do whatever you want
to: calculate values procedurally, call other code, etc. The sky is
the limit. We could define a Monster subclass whose attack string
changed based on the phase of the moon if we wanted to. (Handy for
werewolves, I suppose.)</p>
<p>When we use the Type Object pattern instead, we replace an overridden
method with a member variable. Instead of having monster subclasses
that override a method to <em>calculate</em> an attack string using different
<em>code</em>, we have a breed object that <em>stores</em> an attack string in a
different <em>variable</em>.</p>
<p>This makes it very easy to use type objects to define type-specific
<em>data</em>, but hard to define type-specific <em>behavior</em>. If, for example,
different breeds of monster needed to use different AI algorithms,
using this pattern becomes more challenging.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways we can get around this limitation. A simple
solution is to have a fixed set of pre-defined behaviors, and then use
data in the type object to simply <em>select</em> one of them. For example,
let&#x2019;s say our monster AI will always be either &ldquo;stand
still&rdquo;, &ldquo;chase hero&rdquo;, or &ldquo;whimper and cower in
fear&rdquo; (hey, they can&#x2019;t all be mighty dragons). We can define
<span name="fn">functions</span> to implement each of those behaviors. Then we can associate
an AI algorithm with a breed by simply having it store a pointer to
the appropriate function.</p>
<aside name="fn">

<p>Sound familiar again? Now we&#x2019;re back to really implementing vtables
in <em>our</em> type objects.</p>
</aside>

<p>Another more powerful solution is to actually support defining
behavior completely in <span name="data">data</span>. The <a class="gof-pattern"
href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?InterpreterPattern">Interpreter</a>,
and <a class="pattern" href="bytecode.html">Bytecode</a>
patterns both let us build objects that represent behavior. If we read
in a data file and use that to create a data structure for one of
these patterns, we&#x2019;ve moved the behavior&#x2019;s definition completely out
of code and into content.</p>
<aside name="data">

<p>Over time, games are getting more data-driven. Hardware gets more
powerful, and we find ourselves limited more by how much content we
can author than how hard we can push the hardware. With a 64K
cartridge, the challenge was <em>cramming</em> the gameplay into it. With a
double-sided DVD, the challenge is <em>filling</em> it with gameplay.</p>
<p>Scripting languages and other higher-level ways of defining game
behavior can give us a much needed productivity boost, at the expense
of less optimal runtime performance. Since hardware keeps getting
better but our brainpower doesn&#x2019;t, that trade-off starts to make more
and more sense.</p>

<h3><a href="#a-basic-type-object" name="a-basic-type-object">A basic type object</a></h3>
<p>For our first pass at an implementation, let&#x2019;s start simple and build
the basic system described in the &ldquo;Motivation&rdquo; section.
We&#x2019;ll start with the Breed class we described:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Breed</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="n">Breed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">health</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">attack</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">health_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">health</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">attack_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attack</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{}</span>

  <span class="kt">int</span>         <span class="n">getHealth</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">health_</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">getAttack</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">attack_</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span>         <span class="n">health_</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Starting health.</span>
  <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">attack_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Very simple. It&#x2019;s basically just a container for two data fields: the
starting health and the attack string. Let&#x2019;s see how Monster uses it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Monster</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="n">Monster</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Breed</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">breed</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">health_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">breed</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">getHealth</span><span class="p">()),</span>
    <span class="n">breed_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">breed</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{}</span>

  <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">getAttack</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">breed_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">getAttack</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span>    <span class="n">health_</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Current health.</span>
  <span class="n">Breed</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">breed_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When we construct a Monster, we give it a reference to a Breed object.
This defines the monster&#x2019;s breed instead of the subclasses we were
previously using. In the constructor, Monster uses the breed to
determine its starting health. To get the attack string, Monster
simply forwards the call to its breed.</p>
<p>This very simple chunk of code is the core idea of the pattern.
Everything from here on out is bonus.</p>
<h3><a href="#making-type-objects-more-like-types-constructors" name="making-type-objects-more-like-types-constructors">Making type objects more like types: constructors</a></h3>
<p>With what we have now, we construct a monster directly and are
responsible for passing in its breed. This is a bit backwards from
how regular objects are instantiated in most OOP languages: we don&#x2019;t
usually allocate a blank chunk of memory and then <em>give</em> it its class.
Instead, we call a constructor function on the class itself, and it&#x2019;s
responsible for giving us a new instance.</p>
<p>We can apply this same <span name="pattern">pattern</span> to our type objects:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Breed</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="n">Monster</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">newMonster</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Monster</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="c1">// Previous Breed code...</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="pattern">

<p>&ldquo;Pattern&rdquo; is the right word here. What we&#x2019;re talking about
is one of the classic patterns from Design Patterns: <a

href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FactoryMethodPattern">Factory Method</a>.</p>
<p>In some languages, this pattern is applied for constructing <em>all</em>
objects. In Ruby, Smalltalk, Objective-C, and other languages where
classes are objects, you construct new instances by calling a method

</aside>

<p>And the class that uses them:</p>

<p>There are a couple of changes to note here. The most obvious one is
the new <code>newMonster()</code> function in Breed. That&#x2019;s our
&ldquo;constructor&rdquo; factory method. There are also two other
minor changes: The real constructor in Monster is now private, and
Breed is a friend class of Monster. These last two changes ensure that
we can <em>only</em> create Monsters by going through <code>newMonster()</code>.</p>
<p>The result is a relatively minor change in how monsters are created.
With our original implementation, creating a monster looked like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Monster</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">monster</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Monster</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">someBreed</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After our changes, it&#x2019;s like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Monster</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">monster</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">someBreed</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">newMonster</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, why do this? There are two steps to creating an object: allocation
and initialization. Monster&#x2019;s constructor lets us do all of the
initialization we need. In our example, that&#x2019;s only storing the breed,
but a full game would be loading graphics, initializing the monster&#x2019;s
AI, and doing other set-up work.</p>
<p>However, that all happens <em>after</em> allocation. We&#x2019;ve already got a
chunk of memory to put our monster into before its constructor is
called. In games, we often want to control that aspect of object
creation too: we&#x2019;ll typically use things like custom allocators or the
<a class="pattern" href="object-pool.html">Object Pool</a> pattern to
control where in memory our objects end up.</p>
<p>Defining a &ldquo;constructor&rdquo; function in Breed gives us a
place to put that logic. Instead of simply calling <code>new</code>, the
<code>newMonster</code> function in Breed can pull the memory from a pool or
custom heap before passing control off to Monster for initialization.
By putting this logic inside Breed, in the <em>only</em> function that has
the ability to create Monsters, we ensure that all monsters go through
the memory management scheme we want.</p>
<h3><a href="#sharing-data-through-inheritance" name="sharing-data-through-inheritance">Sharing data through inheritance</a></h3>
<p>What we have so far is a perfectly serviceable type object system, but
it&#x2019;s pretty basic. Our game will eventually have <em>hundreds</em> of
different breeds, each with dozens of attributes. If a designer wants
to tune all of the thirty different breeds of troll to make them a
little stronger, she&#x2019;s got a lot of tedious data entry ahead of her.</p>
<p>What would help is the ability to share attributes across multiple
<em>breeds</em> in the same way that breeds let us share attributes across
multiple <em>monsters</em>. Just like we did with our original OOP solution,
we can solve this using inheritance. Only, this time, instead of using
our language&#x2019;s inheritance mechanism, we&#x2019;ll implement it ourselves
within our type objects.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, we&#x2019;ll just support single inheritance. In the
same way that a class can have a parent base class, we&#x2019;ll allow a
breed to have a parent breed:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Breed</span>

  <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">attack_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When we construct a breed, we give it a parent that it inherits from.
We can pass in <code>NULL</code> for a base breed that has no ancestors.</p>
<p>To make this useful, a child breed needs to control which attributes
are inherited from its parent and which it overrides and specifies
itself. For our example system, we&#x2019;ll say that a breed overrides the
monster&#x2019;s health by having a non-zero value, and overrides the attack
by having a non-<code>NULL</code> string. Otherwise, the attribute will be
inherited from its parent.</p>
<p>There are two ways we can implement this. One is to handle the delegation dynamically, every time the attribute is requested, like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">Breed</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">getHealth</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Override.</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">health_</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="n">parent_</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">health_</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="c1">// Inherit.</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">parent_</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">getHealth</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">Breed</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">getAttack</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Override.</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attack_</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="n">parent_</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">attack_</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="c1">// Inherit.</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">parent_</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">getAttack</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This has the advantage of doing the right thing if a breed is modified at runtime to no longer override, or no longer inherit some attribute. On the other hand, it takes a bit more memory (it has to retain a pointer to its parent), and it&#x2019;s slower. It has to walk the inheritance chain each time you look up an attribute.</p>
<p>If we can rely on a breed&#x2019;s attributes not changing, a faster solution is to apply the inheritance at <em>construction time</em>. This is called "copy-down" delegation because we <em>copy</em> inherited attributes <em>down</em> into the derived type when it&#x2019;s created. It looks like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Breed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Breed</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">parent</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">health</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">attack</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">health_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">health</span><span class="p">),</span>
  <span class="n">attack_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attack</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Inherit non-overridden attributes.</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parent</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">health</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">health_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">parent</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">getHealth</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attack</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">attack_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">parent</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">getAttack</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that we no longer need a field for the parent breed. Once the constructor is done, we can forget the parent since we&#x2019;ve already copied all of its attributes in. To access a breed&#x2019;s attribute, now we just return the field:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">int</span>         <span class="nf">getHealth</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">health_</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="nf">getAttack</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">attack_</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nice and fast!</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s say our game engine is set up to create the breeds by loading a JSON
file that defines them. It could look like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nt">&quot;Troll&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;health&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">,</span>

  <span class="p">},</span>

    <span class="nt">&quot;parent&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Troll&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;health&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;attack&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The troll archer fires an arrow!&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>

    <span class="nt">&quot;parent&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Troll&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;health&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;attack&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The troll wizard casts a spell on you!&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We&#x2019;d have a chunk of code that reads each breed entry and instantiates
a new Breed instance with its data. As you can see from the <code>"parent": "Troll"</code>
fields above, the Troll Archer and Troll Wizard breeds inherit from the base
Troll breed.</p>
<p>Since both of them have zero for their health, they&#x2019;ll inherit it from
the base Troll breed instead. This means now our designer can tune the
health in Troll and all three breeds will be updated. As the number of
breeds and the number of different attributes each breed has
increases, this can be a big time-saver. Now, with a pretty small
chunk of code, we have an open-ended system that puts control in our
designer&#x2019;s hands and makes the best use of their time. Meanwhile, we
can get back to coding other features.</p>
<h2><a href="#design-decisions" name="design-decisions">Design Decisions</a></h2>
<p>The Type Object pattern lets us build a type system as if we were
designing our own programming language. The design space is wide open,
and we can do all sorts of interesting stuff.</p>
<p>In practice, a few things curtail our fancy. Time and maintainability
will discourage us from anything particularly complicated. More
importantly, whatever type object system we design, our users (often
non-programmers) will need to be able to easily understand it. The
simpler we can make it, the more usable it will be. So what we&#x2019;ll
cover here is the well-trodden design space, and we&#x2019;ll leave the far
reaches for the academics and explorers.</p>
<h3><a href="#is-the-type-object-encapsulated-or-exposed" name="is-the-type-object-encapsulated-or-exposed">Is the Type Object encapsulated or exposed?</a></h3>
<p>In our sample implementation, Monster has a reference to a Breed, but
it doesn&#x2019;t publicly expose it. Outside code can&#x2019;t get directly at the
monster&#x2019;s breed. From the codebase&#x2019;s perspective, monsters are
essentially typeless, and the fact that they have breeds is an implementation detail.</p>
<p>We can easily change this and allow Monster to return its Breed:</p>
<p><span name="null"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Monster</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="n">Breed</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">getBreed</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">breed_</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="c1">// Existing code...</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="null">

<p>As in other examples in this book, we&#x2019;re following a convention where
we return objects by reference instead of pointer to indicate to users
that NULL will never be returned.</p>
</aside>

<p>Doing this changes the design of Monster. The fact that all Monsters
have breeds is now a publicly-visible part of its API. There are
benefits with either choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If the type object is encapsulated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The complexity of the Type Object pattern is hidden from the rest
    of the codebase.</em> It becomes an implementation detail that only
    the typed object has to worry about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The typed object can selectively override behavior from the type
    object</em>. Let&#x2019;s say we wanted to change the monster&#x2019;s attack string
    when it&#x2019;s near death. Since the attack string is always accessed
    through Monster, we have a convenient place to put that code:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">Monster</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">getAttack</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">health_</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">LOW_HEALTH</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;The monster flails weakly.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">breed_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">getAttack</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If outside code was calling <code>getAttack()</code> directly on the Breed,
we wouldn&#x2019;t have the opportunity to insert that logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>We have to write forwarding methods for everything the type
    object exposes.</em> This is the tedious part of this design. If our
    type object class has a large number of methods, the object class
    will have to have its own methods for each of the ones that we
    want to be publicly visible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the type object is exposed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Outside code can interact with type objects without having an
    object.</em> If the type object is encapsulated within an object,
    there&#x2019;s no way to use it without also having an object. This
    prevents us, for example, from using our constructor pattern where
    new Monsters are created by calling a method on the Breed. If
    users can&#x2019;t get to Breeds directly, they won&#x2019;t be able to do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The type object is now part of the object&#x2019;s public API.</em> In
    general, narrow interfaces are easier to maintain than wide ones:
    the less you expose to the rest of the codebase, the less
    complexity and maintenance you have to deal with. By exposing the
    type object, we widen the object&#x2019;s API to include everything the
    type object provides.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#how-are-typed-objects-created" name="how-are-typed-objects-created">How are typed objects created?</a></h3>
<p>With this pattern, each &ldquo;object&rdquo; is now a pair of objects:
the main object and the type object it uses. So how do we create and
bind the two together?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Construct the object and pass in its type object:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Outside code can control allocation.</em> Since the calling code is
    constructing both objects itself, it can control where in memory
    that occurs. If we want our objects to be usable in a variety of
    different memory scenarios (different allocators, on the stack,
    etc.) this gives us the flexibility to do that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Call a &ldquo;constructor&rdquo; function on the type object:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The type object controls memory allocation.</em> This is the other
    side of the coin. If we <em>don&#x2019;t</em> want users to choose where in
    memory our objects are created, requiring them to go through a
    factory method on the type object gives us control over that. This
    can be useful if we want to ensure all of our objects come from a
    certain <a class="pattern" href="object-pool.html">Object Pool</a>
    or other memory allocator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#can-the-type-change" name="can-the-type-change">Can the type change?</a></h3>
<p>So far, we&#x2019;ve presumed that once an object is created and bound to its
type object that that binding will never change. The type an object is
created with is the type it dies with. This isn&#x2019;t strictly necessary.
We <em>could</em> allow an object to change its type over time.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s look back at our example. When a monster dies, the designers
tell us sometimes they want its corpse to become a reanimated zombie.
We could implement this by spawning a new monster with a zombie breed
when a monster dies, but another option is to simply get the existing
monster and change its breed to a zombie one.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If the type doesn&#x2019;t change:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It&#x2019;s simpler both to code and to understand.</em> At a conceptual
    level, &ldquo;type&rdquo; is something most people probably will
    not expect to change. This codifies that assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#x2019;s easier to debug.</em> If we&#x2019;re trying to track down a bug where
    a monster gets into some weird state, it simplifies our job if we
    can take for granted that the breed we&#x2019;re looking at <em>now</em> is the
    breed the monster has always had.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the type can change:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>There&#x2019;s less object creation.</em> In our example, if the type can&#x2019;t
    change, we&#x2019;ll be forced to burn CPU cycles creating a new zombie
    monster, copying over any attributes from the original monster
    that need to be preserved, and then deleting it. If we can simply
    change the type, all that work gets replaced by a simple
    assignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>We need to be careful that assumptions are met.</em> There&#x2019;s a fairly
    tight coupling between an object and its type. For example, a
    breed might assume that a monster&#x2019;s <em>current</em> health is never
    above the starting health that comes from the breed.</p>
<p>If we allow the breed to change, we need to make sure that the new
type&#x2019;s requirements are met by the existing object. When we change
the type, we will probably need to execute some validation code to
make sure the object is now in a state that makes sense for the
new type.</p>

</ul>

</ul>
<h3><a href="#what-kind-of-inheritance-is-supported" name="what-kind-of-inheritance-is-supported">What kind of inheritance is supported?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No inheritance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It&#x2019;s simple.</em> Simplest is often best. If you don&#x2019;t have a ton of
    data that needs sharing between your type objects, why make things
    hard on yourself?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can lead to duplicated effort.</em> I&#x2019;ve yet to see an authoring
    system where designers <em>didn&#x2019;t</em> want some kind of inheritance.
    When you&#x2019;ve got fifty different kinds of elves, having to tune
    their health by changing the same number in fifty different places
    <em>sucks</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single inheritance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It&#x2019;s still relatively simple.</em> It&#x2019;s easy to implement, but, more
    importantly, it&#x2019;s also pretty easy to understand. If non-technical
    users are going to be working with the system, the fewer moving
    parts, the better. There&#x2019;s a reason a lot of programming languages
    only support single inheritance. It seems to be a sweet spot
    between power and simplicity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Looking up attributes is slower.</em> To get a given piece of data
    from a type object, we may now need to walk up the inheritance
    chain to find the type that ultimately decides the value. If we&#x2019;re
    in performance critical code, we may not want to spend time on
    this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple inheritance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Almost all data duplication can be avoided.</em> With a good multiple
    inheritance system, users can build a hierarchy for their type
    objects that has almost no redundancy. When it comes time to tune
    numbers, we can avoid a lot of copy and paste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#x2019;s complex.</em> Unfortunately, the benefits for this seem to be
    more theoretical than practical. Multiple inheritance is hard to
    understand and reason about.</p>
<p>If our Zombie Dragon type inherits both from Zombie and Dragon,
which attributes come from Zombie and which come from Dragon? In
order to use the system, users will need to understand how the
inheritance graph is traversed and have the foresight to design an
intelligent hierarchy.</p>

<p>Most C++ coding standards I see today tend to ban multiple
    inheritance, and Java and C# lack it completely. That&#x2019;s an
    acknowledgement of a sad fact: it&#x2019;s so hard to get it right that
    it&#x2019;s often best to not use it at all. While it&#x2019;s worth thinking
    about, it&#x2019;s rare that you&#x2019;ll want to use multiple inheritance for
    the type objects in your games. As always, simpler is better.</p>

<p>The high-level problem this pattern addresses is sharing data and
    behavior between several objects. Another pattern that addresses
    the same problem in a different way is <a class="gof-pattern"
    href="prototype.html">Prototype</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&#x2019;s a lot of similarity between this pattern and the <a
    class="gof-pattern" href="state.html">State</a> pattern. Both
    patterns let an object delegate part of what defines itself to
    another object. With a Type Object, we&#x2019;re usually delegating what
    the object <em>is</em>: invariant data that broadly describes the object.
    With State, we delegate what an object <em>is right now</em>: temporal
    data that describes an object&#x2019;s current configuration.</p>
<p>When we discussed having an object change its type, you can look
at that as having our Type Object serve double duty as a State
too.</p>
