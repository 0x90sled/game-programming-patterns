<ul>
<li>if want something lighter-weight and faster, observer is close cousin</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>random notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>motivations</li>
<li>decouple when event happens from when respond to it</li>
<li>make responding to event not block sender</li>
<li>respond to event on different thread</li>
<li>batch or coalesce events together</li>
<li>prioritize and drop events</li>
<li>
<p>respond to events at appropriate time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have to think about lifetime of event object itself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>need to ensure that when event is received later, world state is still
  meaningful and useful for handler</p>
</li>
<li>for example, send "monster died" event</li>
<li>achievement system wants to track it</li>
<li>gets event five frames later</li>
<li>
<p>by then, monster object is deleted, so achievement system can&#x2019;t tell what
    kind of monster it was or anything else about it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>observer will crash on cycles. queue can handle it (though can get stuck in
  feedback loop)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dovetails really nicely with fsms, which want to receive stream of events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1-many, many-1, and many-to-many queues</p>
</li>
<li>1-many: broadcast events. like observer pattern<ul>
<li>more likely to use "events"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>many-1: sink. think audio engine where anything can tell it to play a sound
    and it has one internal queue is uses to process those requests<ul>
<li>more likely to use "messages"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>many-many: like global event bus. anything can announce something
    interesting. anything can receive it. filtering becomes much more important.</p>
<ul>
<li>see also blackboards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>talk about threading</p>
</li>
<li>with observer, message receiver always runs on <em>sender&#x2019;s</em> thread</li>
<li>with queue, can hop threads so receiver runs on thread it expects to run on</li>
<li>with a global event queue, that means objects listening to queue can end up
  with infinite lifetime if not explicitly unregistered. talk about memory
  leak</li>
<li>coalescing or batching events together</li>
<li>event priority to handle too many queued events</li>
<li>talk about ordering. is it a strict queue or can things be delivered out of
  order? how does threading affect that?</li>
<li>relate to job systems and worker threads?</li>
<li>relate to event-based programming</li>
<li>game loop is sort of like event loop where "event" is a tick</li>
<li>some simple games can actually use os event loop for game loop by updating
    game on "idle" events. not precise enough for real-time games</li>
<li>publish/subscribe</li>
<li>very similar model</li>
<li>usually used to describe behavior of distributed systems, and not within
    single application</li>
<li>sample code should walk through ring buffer</li>
<li>contrast with actor model: each actor has queue, but event/message is sent
  to specific actor and not broadcast</li>
<li>mention erlang</li>
<li>maybe talk about single global queue, then discuss more localized queues</li>
<li>eventually consider each game entity has its own queue</li>
<li>
<p>ta-da actor pattern</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>channels in go</p>
</li>
<li>talk a bit about message queues as middleware in business apps: zeromq, etc.</li>
<li>queueing is helpful for networking.</li>
<li>gives meaningful serializable thing to send to server</li>
<li>
<p>see command pattern</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>talk about how user input is usually queue</p>
</li>
<li>link to game loop which discusses pulling input versus push</li>
<li>
<p>also talk about in general about when to pull events off queues and how that
    ties to game loop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have to think about what event/message represents. is it notice that thing
  happened, or request for thing to happen?</p>
</li>
<li>for example, do we sent "object collided" event and wait for audio engine
    to receive that and play sound, or do we sent "play collision sound"
    message?</li>
<li>depends on sender and intended receiver</li>
<li>if queue is global, event is usually what happened</li>
<li>if queue is specific to obj or system, usually message: request for action</li>
<li>if sender and intended receiver are in different domains (physics and audio)
    then usually event. if in same domain (audio component of actor and audio
    engine) to be command or message</li>
</ul>
