<p>The Observer
pattern is one of the most wildly successful programming patterns in existence.
It was <span name="devised">devised</span> in tandem with the larger Model-View-Controller architecture
which is structure underlying countless applications.</p>
<aside name="devised">

<p>Like so many things in software, it was invented by Smalltalkers in the seventies.
Lispers probably came up with in the sixties and didn&#x2019;t bother writing it down.</p>
</aside>

<p>As web pages have started to become web applications, it&#x2019;s becoming widely used there too. It&#x2019;s so important that Java put it in its core library (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Observer.html"><code>java.util.Observer</code></a>) and C# baked them right into the <em>language</em> (the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8627sbea.aspx"><code>event</code></a> keyword).</p>
<p>But the world of game development can be strangely cloistered at times. Just in case you haven&#x2019;t left the abbey in a while, let me walk you through a motivating example.</p>
<h2><a href="#achievement-unlocked" name="achievement-unlocked">Achievement Unlocked</a></h2>
<p>Say you&#x2019;re adding an achievements system to your game. These will be dozens of different badges players can earn for completing certain specific milestones, like "Kill 100 Monkey Demons", "Fire a Shotgun in the Dark", "Fall of a Bridge", or "Chug Ten Cans of Nutri-Beer".</p>
<p>This is tricky to implement cleanly since you have such a wide range of achievements that can be unlocked by varying but very specific behaviors. You really don&#x2019;t want tendrils of your achievement system twining their way through every dark corner of your codebase. Sure, "Fall of a Bridge" is somehow tied to the <span name="physics">physics engine</span>, but do you really want to see a call to <code>unlockFallOffBridge()</code> right in the middle of the linear algebra in your collision resolution algorithm?</p>
<aside name="physics">

<p>This is a rhetorical question. No self-respecting physics programmer would ever let you sully their beautiful mathematics with something as pedestrian as <em>gameplay</em>.</p>
</aside>

<p>What we&#x2019;d like, as always, is to have all the code concerned with one aspect of the game nicely lumped in one place. The challenge is that achievements are triggered by a bunch of different parts of the game. How can that work without coupling the achievement code to all of these?</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s what the observer pattern is for. It&#x2019;s a pattern for letting one piece of code trigger a notification that something happened <em>without actually caring who gets the notification</em>. For example, you&#x2019;ve got some physics code that handles gravity and tracking which bodies are relaxing calmy on nice flat surfaces and which are plummeting towards sure demise. To handle the "Fall of a Bridge" achievement, you could just jam the code right in there, but that&#x2019;s a mess. Instead, the code that handles entity falling just does:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Physics</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">updateBody</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">PhysicsBody</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">body</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">wasOnSurface</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">isOnSurface</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">accelerate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">GRAVITY</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">wasOnSurface</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">isOnSurface</span><span class="p">())</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">notify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">EVENT_START_FALL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">body</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>All it does is say, "Uh, I don&#x2019;t know if anyone cares, but this thing just fell. Do with that as you will."</p>
<p>The little achievement engine then registers itself to receive that notification. Whenever the physics code sends that notification, the achievement code receives it. It then checks to see if the body is for the player. If so, it checks its own bookkeeping data to see what the less-than-graceful hero happened to be standing on prior to his encounter with classical mechanics. If it&#x2019;s a bridge, it unlocks the proper achievement and sets of the fireworks and fanfare, all with no involvement from the physics code.</p>
<p>In fact, you can change the set of achievements or tear out the entire achievement system without touching a line of gameplay code. It will still send out its notifications, oblivious to the fact that nothing may be receiving them anymore.</p>
<h2><a href="#how-it-works" name="how-it-works">How it Works</a></h2>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t know the mechanics of the actual pattern, you can probably guess
them just from the description, but do keep things easy on you, I&#x2019;ll just walk
through it quickly.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ll start with the nosy class that wants to know when some other object does something interesting. It does this by implementing this:</p>
<p><span name="signature"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Observer</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">Observer</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">onNotify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">Entity</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">entity</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Event</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="signature">

<p>The actual signature of this method is totally up to you. That&#x2019;s why this is the Observer <em>pattern</em> and not the "Observer ready-made chunk of code you can just copy and paste into your game". Usually, the notify method takes the object that&#x2019;s sending the notification and some other generic "data" parameter that you can use to stuff whatever you want into.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re using a language with generics or templates, you&#x2019;ll probably use them here, but it&#x2019;s also perfectly fine to have some more specifically tailored to your use case. Here, I&#x2019;m just hardcoding it to take a game entity, and some arbitrary enum that describes what happened to the entity.</p>
</aside>

<p>A concrete class becomes an observer by implementing this interface. In our example, it&#x2019;s the achievement system, so you&#x2019;d have something like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Achievements</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Observer</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

      <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">unlock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ACHIEVEMENT_FELL_OFF_BRIDGE</span><span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
      <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>

      <span class="c1">// Handle other events, and update heroIsOnBridge_...</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">unlock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Achievement</span> <span class="n">achievement</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Unlock if not already unlocked...</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">heroIsOnBridge_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It receives a notification by having its <code>onNotify()</code> method called by the object that&#x2019;s doing something interesting. In Gang of Four parlance, that&#x2019;s called the
"Subject". The subject has two jobs. First, it holds the list of observers that are waiting oh-so-patiently for a missive from it:</p>
<p><span name="stl"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Subject</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">protected:</span>
  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">notify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">Entity</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">entity</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Event</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="n">Observer</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">observers_</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">MAX_OBSERVERS</span><span class="p">];</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">numObservers_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<aside name="stl">

<p>In real code, you would invariably use a dynamically-sized list or vector type here instead of a dumb array. I&#x2019;m sticking with the basics here to keep things simple for people coming from other languages that don&#x2019;t know C++&#x2019;s standard library.</p>
</aside>

<p>The important bit is that the subject exposes a <em>public</em> API for modifying that list:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Subject</span>

</pre></div>


<p>This way, outside code is responsible for adding <em>itself</em> to the list of observers that the subject will notify. This way, the subject can communicate to the observers without its code being coupled to them. That&#x2019;s the clever part about this pattern.</p>
<p>The fact that it has a <em>list</em> of observers instead of a single one is important too. Sure, it&#x2019;s handy to have multiple observers of a single subject, but it also makes sure that the observers aren&#x2019;t implicitly coupled to <em>each other</em>. For example, lets say the audio engine also observes the fall event so that it can play an appropriate sound.</p>
<p>If the subject only allowed one observer, when the audio engine registered itself, that would <em>un</em>register the achievements system. That means those two systems would be interfering with each other, and in a particularly nasty way, since one basically breaks the other. Supporting a list of observers ensures that each observer is treated independently from the others. As far as they know, they are the only thing in the world with eyes on the subject.</p>
<p>The other job of the subject is actually sending the notification. The basic method for that is simple:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Subject</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">notify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">Entity</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">entity</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Event</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">numObservers_</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">observers_</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">onNotify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">entity</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once have this, we just need to hook it into the physics engine so that observers can observe it and it can send notifications. To stay close to the original <em>Design Patterns</em> recipe we&#x2019;ll <span name="event">inherit</span> <code>Subject</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Physics</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">Subject</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">updateBody</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">PhysicsBody</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">body</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This lets us define <code>notify()</code> in <code>Subject</code> as protected. That way <code>Physics</code> itself can send notifications, but code outside the physics engine cannot. Meanwhile, <code>addObserver()</code> and <code>removeObserver()</code> are public, so anything that can get to the physics system can observe it.</p>
<aside name="event">

<p>If this were real code, I would absolutely avoid using inheritance here. Instead, I&#x2019;d make <code>Physics</code> <em>have</em> an instance of <code>Subject</code>. Instead of observing the physics engine itself, it would expose event objects for things like falling. Observers could register themselves using something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">physics</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">entityFell</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">addObserver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To me, this is the difference between "observer" systems and "event" systems. With the former, you observe <em>the thing that did something interesting</em>. With the latter, you observe an object that represents <em>the thing that happened</em>.</p>
</aside>

<p>Now, when the physics engine does something noteworthy, it calls <code>notify()</code> just like in the motivation example above. That walks the observer list and gives them all the heads up. Pretty simple, right? Just one class that maintains a list of pointers to instances of some interface.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s hard to believe that something so straightforward is the cornerstone of the architecture of thousands of programs and app frameworks.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-about-games" name="what-about-games">What About Games?</a></h2>
<p>If it&#x2019;s such a big deal outside of the game industry, how does it fare inside?
Here, it seems to have gotten a mixed reception. Part of this is the observer
pattern usually rides along with MVC, and that isn&#x2019;t very popular in games.</p>
<p>In most applications I&#x2019;ve seen, "MVC" really means a two-layer approach: front end and back end. The big-C "controller" part of MVC is this weird little orphan that no one knows what to do with and every framework redefines to something arbitrary.</p>
<p>That separation makes a lot of sense in most applications. The app has some complex state that needs to be modified and persisted. It&#x2019;s usually stored in a database or on files. There is complex business logic defining what kind of modifications are valid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the user interface is fairly separate from that, changes frequently, and may have different views into the same underlying data. A chart and grid of cells really are "views" into a distinct "model", which is the tabular data of a spreadsheet. It&#x2019;s still conceptually a "spreadsheet" even if you ditch the chart and radically change the UI.</p>
<p>Games don&#x2019;t have that same <span name="separation">separation</span>. Is a visual effect particle&#x2019;s position "front-end"? After all, it&#x2019;s used to determine where the player sees it on-screen, a purely visual user experience distinction. But a particle is positioned in space in the game world, and that position interacts physically with the world. Isn&#x2019;t the game world the "model"?</p>
<aside name="separation">

<p>I think this is part of the reason the <a href="component.html" class="pattern">Component</a> pattern is so popular: games <em>can</em> be pretty effectively divided into different domains like physics, AI, and rendering. Components are the MVC of games.</p>
</aside>

<p>Without a clear front-end/back-end separation, cramming MVC into a game is hard, so the observer pattern hasn&#x2019;t gotten a free ride there. When I ask other game programmers if they use it, some simply haven&#x2019;t heard of it. Some do use it, but I also hear the same couple of explanations for why they avoid it. The rest of this chapter is going to be about those challenges, what we can do to meet them, and why you might or might not want to bother.</p>
<h2><a href="#it&#x2019;s-too-slow" name="it&#x2019;s-too-slow">It&#x2019;s Too Slow</a></h2>
<p>The last time I asked around about this pattern, the first response I heard was that some people didn&#x2019;t like it because it&#x2019;s too "slow". They didn&#x2019;t know the details of the pattern, but their default impression of anything "design-patterny" is that it involves piles of classes and indirection and all sorts of other creative ways of wasting CPU cycles.</p>
<p>The Observer pattern gets a particularly bad rap here because it&#x2019;s been known to hang around with some shady characters named "events", <span name="names">"messages"</span>, and even "data binding". Some of those systems, <em>can</em> be slow, often deliberately. They involve things like queuing or dynamically allocating and then later destroying objects that represent notifications.</p>
<aside name="names">

<p>This is an example of why I think documenting patterns is so important. When we get fuzzy about terminology and what things mean, it&#x2019;s impossible to communicate clearly and succintly. You say, "Observer" and they hear "Messaging" because either no one bothered to write down the difference or they didn&#x2019;t happen to read it.</p>
</aside>

<p>But, now that we&#x2019;ve covered how the pattern is actually implemented, you can see that isn&#x2019;t the case. Sending a notification is just walking a list and calling some virtual methods. Granted, that&#x2019;s a <em>bit</em> slower than a statically dispatched method, but that performance hit is negligible in all but the most performance critical code.</p>
<p>My experience is that this pattern is best used outside of critical code paths anyway, so you can usually afford the dispatch cost there. Outside of that, there&#x2019;s virtually no overhead. We aren&#x2019;t allocating objects for messages. There&#x2019;s no queueing. It&#x2019;s just an indirection over a method call.</p>

<p>In fact, you have to be careful because the Observer pattern <em>is</em> synchronous. Since the subject invokes its observers directly, that means the subject can&#x2019;t resume its work until all of the observers have returned from their notification methods. A slow observer can block a subject.</p>
<p>This sounds scary, but in practice it&#x2019;s not the end of the world. It&#x2019;s just something you have to be aware of. UI programmers, who&#x2019;ve been doing event-based programming like this for ages, have a deeply-ingrained mantra about this: "get off the UI thread". If you&#x2019;re responding to a UI event synchronously, you need to finish and return control as quickly as possible so that the UI doesn&#x2019;t lock up.</p>
<p>If you have slow to work to do, push it onto another thread or some sort of work queue. It takes a little discipline, but it&#x2019;s not rocket science. If this is a problem for you, then maybe a queuing message system <em>is</em> what you want. Fortunately, I&#x2019;ve got a chapter just for that: <a href="message-queue" class="pattern">Message Queue</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#it-does-too-much-dynamic-allocation" name="it-does-too-much-dynamic-allocation">It Does Too Much Dynamic Allocation</a></h2>
<p>Large swathes of the software world, including many game developers have moved
onto garbage collected languages, and dynamic allocation isn&#x2019;t the boogie man
that it used to be for most people. But for performance critical software like
games, memory allocation still matters, even in managed languages. Dynamic allocation takes time, as does reclaiming memory&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;either manually or automatically.</p>
<p>Even more of a concern in games can be memory <span name="fragment">fragmentation</span>. As you allocate and free bits of memory over time, the heap gets increasingly broken into smaller contiguous chunks of free memory. Eventually, even if the <em>total</em> available memory is high, you may not find a single big enough chunk to allocate. In games, where you may need to run continuously for days without crashing in order to get certified, that&#x2019;s a real concern.</p>
<aside name="fragment">

<p>The <a href="object-pool.html" class="pattern">Object Pool</a> chapter goes into more detail about fragmentation and how to avoid it.</p>
</aside>

<p>In my sample code above, I just used a fixed array because I&#x2019;m trying to keep
things dead simple. In real implementations, the observer list is almost always
a dynamically allocated array or list that grows and shrinks as observers are
added and removed. That allocation spooks some people.</p>
<p>The first thing you&#x2019;ll notice is that it only munges memory when things are being wired up. To send a notification, there&#x2019;s no memory allocation at all. It&#x2019;s just a method call. So, if you wire up your observers at the start of the game and don&#x2019;t mess with them much, the allocation churn here may be minimal. It may not be a problem at all.</p>
<p>If it is, though, here&#x2019;s a way to implement the pattern without any dynamic
allocation at all&hellip;</p>
<h3><a href="#linked-observers" name="linked-observers">Linked observers</a></h3>
<p>For the pattern to work, the subject needs to maintain list of the objects that are observing it. Usually, it does that by owning a list that contains a bunch of pointers to observers. But notice that the <code>Observer</code> interface is a class. In most implementations, it&#x2019;s a pure virtual interface, and we all know interfaces are better than concrete, stateful classes.</p>
<p>But if we <em>are</em> willing to put a bit of state in there, we can thread the list <em>through the observers themselves</em>. Instead of the subject having a separate list of pointers to observers, it will just point to the first one, which will in turn point to the next one, and on down the line.</p>
<p>First, we&#x2019;ll get rid of the array in <code>Subject</code> and replace it with a pointer to the head of the list of observers:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Subject</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Methods...</span>
<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="n">Observer</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">head_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then we&#x2019;ll extend <code>Observer</code> with a pointer to the next observer in the list:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Observer</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">friend</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Subject</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="n">Observer</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">next_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{}</span>

  <span class="c1">// Other stuff...</span>
<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="n">Observer</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">next_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We&#x2019;re also making <code>Subject</code> a friend here. The subject owns the API for adding and removing observers, but the list it will be managing is now inside the <code>Observer</code> class itself. The simplest way to give it the ability to poke at that list is by making it a friend.</p>
<p>Wiring up an observer is just adding it to the list. I&#x2019;ll take the simplest
option and push it onto the <em>head</em> of the list:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Subject</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">addObserver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Observer</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">observer</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">observer</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">next_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">head_</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">head_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">observer</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The other option would be add it to the <em>end</em> of the linked list. Doing that would add a bit more complexity here: <code>Subject</code> would either have to walk the list to find the end, or keep track of a separate <code>tail_</code> pointer that always points to the last node.</p>
<p>Adding it to the front of the list is simpler, but does have one side effect. When we walk that list to send a notification to every observer, the most recently registered observer will get notified first. If you register observers A, B, and C, in that order, when it notifies, they will be received in C, B, A order. That may not be what you expect.</p>
<p>In theory, this doesn&#x2019;t matter one way or the other. It&#x2019;s a tenant of good observer discipline that two observers observing the same subject should have no ordering dependencies relative to each other. If the ordering <em>does</em> matter, it means those two observers have some subtle coupling that could end up biting you.</p>
<p>Regardless of which end of the list we add the new observer, you can see we achieved our goal here: adding an observer is just a couple of pointer assignments. Not an allocation in sight!</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s get removing working:</p>
<p><span name="remove"></span></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Subject</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">removeObserver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Observer</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">observer</span><span class="p">)</span>

<aside name="remove">

<p>Removing a node from a linked list usually requires a bit of ugly special case handling for removing the very first node, like you see here. If you&#x2019;re comfortable with pointer shenanigans, there&#x2019;s a more elegant solution using a pointer to a pointer to a node. Consider it an exercise for the reader.</p>
</aside>

<p>Because we have a singly linked list, we have to walk it to find the observer we&#x2019;re removing. We&#x2019;d have to do the same thing if we were using a regular array for that matter. If we use a <em>doubly</em> linked list, where each observer has a pointer to both the observer after it and before it in the list, we can remove an observer in constant time. If this were real code, I&#x2019;d do that. In my experience, I find doubly linked lists almost always more useful thank singly linked ones.</p>
<p>The only thing left for us to do is implement sending a notification. That&#x2019;s as simple as walking the list:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">Subject</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">notify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">Entity</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">entity</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Event</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">Observer</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">observer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">head_</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">observer</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">observer</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">onNotify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">entity</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">observer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">observer</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">next_</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Not too bad, right? A subject can have as many observers as it wants, without doing a bit of memory management. Registering and unregistering is as fast as it was with a simple array. There&#x2019;s only two quibbles with this. The first is that walking a linked list means skipping around in memory more. That can cause <span name="cache">cache misses</span>, which harm your performance. In hot code paths, that may be unacceptable.</p>
<aside name="cache">

<p>See the chapter on <a href="data-locality.html" class="pattern">Data Locality</a> for a ton of more information on how CPU caching affects performance and what you can do about it.</p>
</aside>

<p>The other problem is a more basic limitation. With this design, an observer is <em>itself</em> in the list of observers for a given subject. Since it is only one object, that means an observer can only be in one of those lists. In other words, it can only observe one subject at a time. In a vanilla observer implementation where each subject has its own independent list, an observer can be in more than one of those lists without any problem.</p>
<h3><a href="#a-pool-of-list-nodes" name="a-pool-of-list-nodes">A pool of list nodes</a></h3>
<p>You may be able to live with this limitation. I find it more common for a subject to have multiple observers than vice versa. If this limitation <em>is</em> a problem for you, there is another more complex solution you can use that still doesn&#x2019;t require dynamic allocation. It&#x2019;s too long to cram into this chapter, but I&#x2019;ll sketch it out an maybe you can fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that each subject will have a linked list of observers. Unlike the design we just saw, those nodes won&#x2019;t be observers themselves. Instead, they&#x2019;ll be separate little "node" objects that just contain a pointer to the actual observer and then a pointer to the next node in the list. This way, multiple nodes can point to the same observer.</p>
<p>The way you avoid dynamic allocation is simple: Since all of those nodes are the same type, you can just create an <a href="object-pool.html" class="pattern">Object Pool</a> for them. That gives you a fixed-size pile of list nodes to work with, and you can use and reuse them as you need without having to hit an actual memory allocator.</p>
<h2><a href="#it&#x2019;s-too-awesome" name="it&#x2019;s-too-awesome">It&#x2019;s Too Awesome?</a></h2>
<p>I think I&#x2019;ve shown that you can overcome most of the techical limitations of the pattern. If that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s holding you back, it shouldn&#x2019;t. But does that mean you <em>should</em> use it?</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s a harder question. Like all design patterns the Observer pattern isn&#x2019;t a panacea. Even when implemented correctly and efficiently, it may not be the right solution. The reason design patterns get a bad rap is because people apply good patterns to the wrong problem and end up making things worse.</p>
<p>There are two challenges with the Observer pattern, one technical and one at something more like the codebase usability level. We&#x2019;ll do the techical one first because those are always easier than human factors issues.</p>
<h3><a href="#destroying-subjects-and-observers" name="destroying-subjects-and-observers">Destroying subjects and observers</a></h3>
<p>I think the sample code I&#x2019;ve walked through is solid for what it is, but it completely side-steps an important issue: when happens when you delete a subject or an observer? If you just blindly call <code>delete</code> on an observer, one or more subjects may still have pointers to it. Those are now dangling free. When a subject comes along and tries to send a notification to it, you&#x2019;re going to take a trip to that bad place called "Undefined Behavior" that makes people hate C and C++.</p>
<p>Destroying the subject is easier since in most implementations the observer doesn&#x2019;t have any references to it. But even then, sending its bits straight to the memory manager&#x2019;s recycle bin may cause some problems. Those observers may still be expecting to receive notifications in the future, and they have no way of knowing that will never happen now. They really aren&#x2019;t observers at all any more, they just think they are.</p>
<p>You can deal with this in a couple of different ways. The simplest is to do what I did and just punt on it. It&#x2019;s an observer&#x2019;s job to unregister itself from any subjects when it gets deleted. More often than not, the observer <em>does</em> know which subjects it&#x2019;s observing, so it&#x2019;s usually just a matter of <span name="destructor">adding</span> a <code>removeObserver()</code> call to its destructor.</p>
<aside name="destructor">

<p>As always, the hard part isn&#x2019;t doing it, it&#x2019;s <em>remembering</em> to do it.</p>
</aside>

<p>If you don&#x2019;t want to leave observers hanging when a subject gives up the ghost, that&#x2019;s easy to fix. Just have the subject send one final "dying breath" notification right before it gets destroyed. That way any observer can receive that and take whatever action (mourn, send flowers, etc.) it thinks is appropriate.</p>
<p>Both of these require you to remember to do the right thing in each class that touches this pattern. People, even we half-robot programmers, are reliably terrible at being reliable. That&#x2019;s why we invented computers: they never make mistakes.</p>
<p>A safer answer is to make observers automatically unregister themselves from every subject when they get destroyed. If you implement the logic for that once in your basic observer class, everyone using it doesn&#x2019;t have to remember to do it themselves. This does add some complexity, though. It means each <em>observer</em> will need a list of the <em>subjects</em> its observing. You need pointers going in both directions.</p>
<h3><a href="#it&#x2019;s-cool,-i&#x2019;ve-got-a-gc" name="it&#x2019;s-cool,-i&#x2019;ve-got-a-gc">It&#x2019;s cool, I&#x2019;ve got a GC</a></h3>
<p>All of you cool kids with your hip modern languages with garbage collectors are feeling pretty smug right now. Think you don&#x2019;t have to worry about this because you never explicitly delete anything? Think again!</p>
<p>Imagine this: you&#x2019;ve got some UI screen that shows a bunch of stats about the player&#x2019;s character like their health and stuff. The player can bring up the screen and dismiss it whenever they want. You implement the screen as an observer where the subject is the main character.</p>
<p>Every time the character takes a punch to the face (or elsewhere, I suppose), it sends a notification. The UI screen observes that and updates the little health bar. Great. Now what happens when the player dismisses the screen, but you don&#x2019;t unregister the observer?</p>
<p>The UI won&#x2019;t be visible anymore, but it will still be in memory. The entire time the player is playing the game, running around, getting in fights, the character will be sending notifications. Those will get sent to the UI screen, which will then reposition a bunch of UI elements and do other utterly pointless work.</p>
<p>This is such a common problem in notification systems that it has a <span name="lapsed">name</span>: the <em>lapsed listener problem</em>. Even though the user may not see a problem, you&#x2019;re wasting memory and CPU cycles on some zombie UI. The lesson here is that you always have to be disciplined about registration.</p>
<aside name="lapsed">

<p>An even surer sign of its significance: it has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapsed_listener_problem">a Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="#what&#x2019;s-going-on" name="what&#x2019;s-going-on">What&#x2019;s going on?</a></h3>
<p>The other, deeper problem with the Observer pattern comes directly from the problem it solves. We reach for Observer because it prevents our code from being too tightly coupled. A subject can indirectly communicate with an observer without being statically bound to its code.</p>
<p>For such a simple pattern, it accomplishes that quite well. But, if you&#x2019;ve ever had to debug a program that uses observers pervasively and isn&#x2019;t doing what it&#x2019;s supposed to do, you&#x2019;ve learned that it decouples things a bit <em>too</em> well.</p>
<p>As you&#x2019;re tracing your way through the codebase, there&#x2019;s no easy way to see which parts of the program are communicating with which other parts. Instead of a simple direct named function call that you can look up, all you see is "send a notification".</p>
<p>To figure out who <em>receives</em> that notification, you have to determine which set of observers happen to be bound to that subject at runtime. Instead of being able to <em>statically</em> reason about the communication structure of the program, you have to reason about its <em>imperative, dynamic</em> behavior.</p>
<p>The coupling is still there. After all, those pieces of code do need to communicate. It&#x2019;s just that now the coupling is an <span name="emergent">emergent</span> property of how the observers happened to be wired up at runtime. When you&#x2019;ve got long chains of observers and subjects, debugging this communication network can be a nightmare.</p>
<aside name="emergent">

<p>I&#x2019;ve worked with programs that treated observers like the One True Religion and figuring out why something working was about as fun as figuring out why a string of Christmas lights won&#x2019;t come on, except instead of a string of them, it was a four-dimensional cyclic graph. And each light could spontaneously unplug itself.</p>
</aside>

<p>There is no perfect solution here. There are real valid reasons to not want to statically staple pieces of your codebase to each other. Maintaining tightly coupled code sucks: it makes it impossible to reason about parts of the program in isolation. And, when the game gets too big to fit in your head, you <em>need</em> to be able to reason about it locally. But replacing that coupling with something more dynamic does mean globally reasoning about your program is harder.</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t cry yourself to sleep though. The trick with this is to use it where it helps and avoid it where it doesn&#x2019;t. Here&#x2019;s a simple guideline: <em>if the subject can&#x2019;t do its own work without having an observer, don&#x2019;t use this pattern</em>.</p>
<p>This pattern is a good fit when the observer cares about the subject but the subject couldn&#x2019;t care less about the observer. If that isn&#x2019;t the case, then it implies there is a real, meaningful coupling between those two objects. In that case, it&#x2019;s usually better to avoid this pattern and make that coupling more explicit.</p>
<p>The Observer pattern is a great way to layer "secondary" or "ancillary" behavior on top of a core shell of "real" work. Like in our example, the physics engine doesn&#x2019;t need an achievement system whatsoever. It&#x2019;s job is physics and it can do that just fine without anyone watching. It supports observers because that&#x2019;s the simplest, least coupled way we can get the achievement system working, but it doesn&#x2019;t do anything for the physics engine itself.</p>
<h2><a href="#observers-today" name="observers-today">Observers Today</a></h2>
<p>Design Patterns came out in the 90s. Back then object-oriented programming was <em>the</em> hot paradigm. Every programmer on Earth wanted to "Learn OOP in 30 Days" and middle managers paid them based on the number of classes they created. Engineers judged their mettle by the depth of their inheritance hiearchies.</p>
<p>The Observer pattern got popular during that zeitgeist, so it&#x2019;s no surprise that it&#x2019;s class heavy. But mainstream programmers today are more familiar with functional programming. Having to implement an entire interface just to receive a notification doesn&#x2019;t fit in today&#x2019;s aesthetic.</p>
<p>It feels heavyweight and rigid. It <em>is</em> heavyweight and rigid! It&#x2019;s impossible to have a single class that can use <span name="different">different methods</span> for observing different subjects.</p>
<aside name="different">

<p>This is why so many implementations of the pattern pass the subject into the notify method. Since an observer can only have a single notify method, if it&#x2019;s observing multiple subjects, it needs to know which one the notification is coming from.</p>
</aside>

<p>A more modern approach is to have an observer just be a reference to a method or function. In languages with first class functions, and especially ones with <span name="closures">closures</span>, this is a much more common way to do observers.</p>
<aside name="closures">

<p>These days practically <em>every</em> language has closures. C++ managed to overcome the challenge of having closures in a language without garbage collection before Java managed to get its act together and introduce them in JDK 8.</p>
</aside>

<p>For example, C# has "events" baked into the language. With those, the listener you register is just a "delegate", which is that language&#x2019;s term for a first-class reference to a method. In JavaScript&#x2019;s event system, observers can be objects supporting a special <code>EventListener</code> protocol, but they can also just be functions. The latter is almost always what people use.</p>
<p>If I were designing an observer system today, I&#x2019;d make it <span name="function">function-based</span> instead of class-based. Even in C++, I would tend towards a system that let you register member function pointers as observers instead of instances of some <code>Observer</code> interface.</p>
<aside name="function">

<p><a href="http://molecularmusings.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/generic-type-safe-delegates-and-events-in-c/">Here&#x2019;s</a> an interesting blog post on one way to implement this in C++.</p>
</aside>

<h2><a href="#observers-tomorrow" name="observers-tomorrow">Observers Tomorrow</a></h2>
<p>Event systems and other observer-like patterns are incredibly common these days. They&#x2019;re a well-worn path. But if you write a few large apps using them, you start to notice something. A very large fraction of the code in your observers is really dumb boilerplate. It&#x2019;s usually something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get notified that some state has changed.</li>
<li>Imperatively modify some chunk of UI to reflect the new state.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#x2019;s all, "Oh, the hero health is 7 now? Let me set the width of the health bar to 70 pixels." After a while, it gets pretty tedious. Computer science academics and software engineer practitioners have been trying to eliminate that tedium for a <em>long</em> time. Their attempts have gone under a number of different names: "dataflow programming", "functional reactive programming", etc.</p>
<p>While there have been some successes, usually in limited domains like audio processing or chip design, the holy grail still hasn&#x2019;t been found. In the meantime, a humbler step in that direction has started gaining traction. Many recent application frameworks now use "data binding".</p>
<p>Unlike FRP, data binding doesn&#x2019;t try to entirely eliminate imperative code and doesn&#x2019;t try to architect your entire application around a giant declarative dataflow graph. What it does do is automate a bunch of the really tedious boilerplate where you&#x2019;re tweaking a UI element to reflect a change to some value.</p>
<p>Like other declarative systems, data binding is probably a bit too sloow and complex to be a good fit for the core of a game engine. But I would be surprised if I didn&#x2019;t see it start making in-roads into less critical areas of the game like UI.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the good old Observer pattern will still be there waiting for us. Sure, it&#x2019;s not as exciting as some hot technique that manages to cram both "functional" and "reactive" in its name, but it&#x2019;s dead simple and it works fine. To me, those are often the two most important criteria for a solution.</p>
